<h1>My first webpage ever!</h1>

<p>A simple 2 page website using HTML and CSS only</p>

<p>Access the code files on my <a href="https://github.com/davidcliffe/personal-website.git"> GitHub page</a> </p>

<h2>Summary</h2> 
<p>I have always been interested in solving problems and programming. Recently I decided I wanted to expand my skills so I could get creative with software tools
and applications.</p>

<p>This website was completed in a week and introduced me to HTML, CSS, git, and GitHub. I found the styling can be tedious and struggled at times since there are
so many ways to make changes. Using git is also something that got me confused several times and will take some effort to get comfortable with. 
Nevertheless I am quite pleased with the result and to have started my journey into the world of software development</p><br>
